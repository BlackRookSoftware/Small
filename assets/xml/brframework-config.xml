	Database Connection Pool Definitions
	====================================

	All Pool definitions go in this tag.
	
	The two types of pools that can be defined in this tag are Database 
	Connection Pools and Thread Pools for asynchronously executed tasks.
	
	Database Connection Pools are defined in "connectionpool" tags, and have
	the following attributes:
	
	name			The name of the pool. This is the key used to identify this 
					pool in the framework. All uses of this pool is through 
					this key. Default is "default".
	
	type			The type of database that the framework will be interfacing
					with. So far, the only valid value for this attribute is 
					"mysql".
	
	If the database type is "mysql", the following attributes are accepted:
	
	user			The username to use for the pooled connections.
					Default is "root".
	
	password		The password to use for the pooled connections.
					Default is blank.
	
	host			The address of the database to connect to.
					Default is "localhost".

	port			The port by which to connect to the database with.
					Default is the default MySQL port (3306).
	
	database		The database to use for all query requests.
					Default is the same value as the user attribute.
	
	connections		The number of connections to open to the database.
					Default is 10.

	If the database type is "sqlite", the following attributes are accepted:
	
	database		The path to the database file. If relative path, it is 
					relative to the application context root.
	
					NOTE: SQLite can only have one connection open to it.
					So, in the case of SQLite, the number of pooled connections
					is 1. Always.

	View Resolvers
	==============
	
	These next XML structures declare the view resolvers to use when
	a framework servlet wants to call or include a view.
	
	The view resolvers are called in the order in which they are declared 
	in this file.
	
	Each view resolver is declared in a "viewresolver" tag, and have the
	following attributes:
	
	class			The fully-qualified classname of the class to instantiate
					for this resolver.
	
-->

<viewresolver 
	class="com.blackrook.framework.resolver.DefaultViewResolver" 
	/>

<!-- 
	Query Resolvers
	===============
	
	These next XML structures declare the query resolvers to use when
	a framework servlet wants to load a query.
	
	The query resolvers are called in the order in which they are declared 
	in this file.
	
	Each query resolver is declared in a "queryresolver" tag, and have the
	following attributes:
	
	class			The fully-qualified classname of the class to instantiate
					for this resolver.
	
-->

<queryresolver 
	class="com.blackrook.framework.resolver.DefaultResolver" 
	/>


<!-- 
	Filters
	===========
	
	These next XML structures declare filters.
	
	Each filter is declared in a "filter" tag, and have the following 
	attributes:
	
	pathprefix		The prefix path of the filter. If the submitted path is
					starts with this, this filter will be used.

	class			The fully-qualified classname of the class to instantiate
					for this filter.
	
-->

<!--
<filter 
	pathprefix="admin/" 
	class="com.blackrook.framework.filter.BRFilter" 
	/>
-->

<!-- 
	Controller Root
	===============
	
	This XML structure declares the root package to resolve controllers from
	should no path be defined for it. The request URL must be processed by 
	BRDispatcherServlet for this to have any effect. Sub-folders in the path
	are considered to be sub-packages.
	
	................................
	
	Controllers are resolved as follows (examples), if the tag is: 
	<controllerroot 
		package="com.example.controller" 
		prefix=""  
		suffix="Controller"
		methodprefix="call"  
		/>
	
	/index/get.view
	com.example.controller.IndexController.callGet(...)

	/someOther/index.view
	com.example.controller.SomeOtherController.callIndex(...)

	/admin/index/index.view
	com.example.controller.admin.IndexController.callIndex(...)
	
	................................

	This definition is considered last after "controller" tags.
	
	The root declaration has the following attributes:
	
	package			The classpath of the root package.
	
	prefix			The prefix prepended to the controller name.
					Default is "", if unspecified. 
	
	suffix			The suffix appended to the controller name.
					Default is "Controller", if unspecified.
	
	methodprefix	The prefix added to the request page for the
					true method to invoke for the request type.
					Default is "call", if unspecified.
