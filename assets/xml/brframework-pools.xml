<!--

	Database Connection Pools are defined in "connectionpool" tags, and have
	the following attributes:
	
	name			The name of the pool. This is the key used to identify this 
					pool in the framework. All uses of this pool is through 
					this key. Default is "default".
	
	type			The type of database that the framework will be interfacing
					with. So far, the only valid value for this attribute is 
					"mysql".
	
	If the database type is "mysql", the following attributes are accepted:
	
	user			The username to use for the pooled connections.
					Default is "root".
	
	password		The password to use for the pooled connections.
					Default is blank.
	
	host			The address of the database to connect to.
					Default is "localhost".

	port			The port by which to connect to the database with.
					Default is the default MySQL port (3306).
	
	database		The database to use for all query requests.
					Default is the same value as the user attribute.
	
	connections		The number of connections to open to the database.
					Default is 10.

	If the database type is "sqlite", the following attributes are accepted:
	
	database		The path to the database file. If relative path, it is 
					relative to the application context root.
	
					NOTE: SQLite can only have one connection open to it.
					So, in the case of SQLite, the number of pooled connections
					is 1. Always.
